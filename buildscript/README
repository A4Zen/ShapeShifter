Generate drawable files
=======================

Place drawable.xml files in drawableTemplates/ with the file named as (e.g.) triangle.xml.

make_hidden.sh takes a filename.xml and generates filename_hidden.xml in tmp/

make_reveal.sh does the same but with filename_reveal

make_all.sh runs the former two scripts on all files in drawableTemplates

install_files.sh moves all the files into the right place

Procedure
=========

Run make_all.sh, check that files in tmp and shape_list.xml look OK, run install_files.sh
